Can I just replace the quotes with escape characters?

Hypothesis:
Step 1: Replace quotes with escape characters 
Step 2 strip escape characters that dont matter.

Doesnt work, awk needs quotes

Lexer then parsing

Quotes are not delimiters. So you need to handle delimiters seperately. c"d .." (dosnt work but is already valid syntax to be passed and doest need any syntaxing)
"<" Stuff inside "blaa$arg blaa" needs to be expanded first then changed into 'blaaargvalue blaa'


One possibility would be to have the token be inside single quotes

$0 is a special parameter that represents the name of the script being executed. When you run a script, the shell assigns $0 to the name of the script. This can be particularly useful for logging, debugging, or providing usage information.
